# MaxLengthWarner

MaxLengthWarner is a Chrome extension which warns the user if they are entering input past the maximum length of an input tag.

When using long passwords on sites which set the max length attribute of input tags, there is no way to tell whether you're entering password characters past the max length of the password input field. This extension adds a shake effect to the input fields, in order to warn the user of the fact that their keypresses are not going into the input field.
